### Hello!

My name is Catherine (She/Her) and I am a current senior at Smith College pursuing a Statistical and Data Sciences degree. Due to my research in a marine ecology lab 🐠 🌊 🦀, my main focus in data analysis has been environmental related. However, I am open to working in any field of research or industry!

### Projects

Here are a few examples of projects that I have worked on:
